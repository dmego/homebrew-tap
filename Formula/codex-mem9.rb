  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Homebrew installs the `codex-mem9` binary and service only.
      Install the skills from the repository separately before you try to run
      the `mem9-setup` skill.

      This Formula installs the published release referenced above (#{version}).
      The installed behavior follows that release tag, not unreleased repository changes.

      Review the README that matches the same published release before configuring
      `brew services`, because configuration behavior can change between tags.
